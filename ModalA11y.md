# Modal Accessibility

- Uses `<dialog>` or `<div role="dialog">` for correct role.
- Supports all ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`).
- Keyboard accessible: focus trap and ESC to close.
- Focus ring is visible for keyboard users.
- Works with screen readers and assistive tech out of the box.

**Best Practices:**

- Use clear, descriptive titles.
- Use `aria-label` for icon-only modals.
- Ensure color contrast for text and focus ring.
