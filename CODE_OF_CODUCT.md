# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyoneâ€”regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments/personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take fair and corrective action in response to any unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or community.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other community leaders.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0.
