# Card Accessibility

- Uses semantic elements for correct role.
- Supports all ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`).
- Keyboard accessible if interactive.
- Focus ring is visible for keyboard users.
- Works with screen readers and assistive tech out of the box.

**Best Practices:**

- Use clear, descriptive headers.
- Use `aria-label` for icon-only cards.
- Ensure color contrast for text and focus ring.
