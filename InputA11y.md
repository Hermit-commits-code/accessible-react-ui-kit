# Input Accessibility

- Uses semantic `<input>` element for correct role.
- Supports all ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-required`).
- Keyboard accessible: can be focused and typed into.
- Focus ring is visible for keyboard users.
- Disabled and required states use proper attributes and are announced by screen readers.
- Works with screen readers and assistive tech out of the box.

**Best Practices:**

- Use clear, descriptive labels.
- Use `aria-label` for icon-only inputs.
- Ensure color contrast for text and focus ring.
